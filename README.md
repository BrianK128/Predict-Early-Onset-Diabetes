# Predict-Early-Onset-Diabetes
Project for Pattern Recognition and Classification course, CPE 646
at Stevens Institute of Technology.

The objective of this project is to predict whether a patient is at risk 
of developing adult onset diabetes based on diagnostic test results.

The dataset used is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database from Kaggle: 
https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database

This project compares the performance of several classifier on the 
reduced dimension data set and normal data set.

Dimension reduction was performed using Principal Component Analysis.

Classifiers used:
SVM
Neural Network with backpropagation
k-NN

All algorithms except SVM were implemented by me. You can check them 
out in the Functions folder.
